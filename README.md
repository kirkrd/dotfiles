# configs

My general config setups for terminals, ide and everything i use on a daily basis as a developer.

## My philosophy when working with software development

- Simple, efficient and stylish

Im writing this setup and guide both for my personal setup on different projects and clients but also to hopefully inspire more people to learn their tools as developers and be more efficient.

## My current setup as of June 2023

### macOS

Application manager: `homebrew`
Terminal shell: `fish`
Terminal: `alacritty`
Window mangement: `yabai` `skhd` `Space Launcher`
Ide: `Nvim`

- Autohide launcher and topbar.
- Accessability reduce motion.
